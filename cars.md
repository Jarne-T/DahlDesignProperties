# Cars

### What is this for?

Through manually mapping out the specifics of various cars the plugin can offer extra properties for these, such as:

* Launch bite point
* Optimal shift RPM
* Pit stop timing and predictions based on this
* Traction control emulation
* Properties used for car specific dashboard configuration and LED animations

The list of supported cars and tracks will be ever growing, but the manual mapping is time consuming.&#x20;

### Supported cars

* GT3
  * Ferrari 488 Evo 2020
  * Audi R8
  * Lamborghini Huracan
