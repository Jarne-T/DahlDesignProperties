# Pit Menu

The pit menu is a system for controlling the plugin and Dashboard.&#x20;

You can bind a rotary switch/encoder to change menu position. Each menu position will have 3 options, which are activated though button presses:

* OK
* \+
* \-

Bindings for the pit menu position switch and the option buttons are in the plugin menu.&#x20;
