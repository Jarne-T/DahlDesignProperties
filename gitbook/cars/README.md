# Cars and tracks

Through manually mapping out the properties of specific cars and tracks in iRacing, the plugin can offer extra properties for these, such as:

* Launch bite point
* Optimal shift RPM
* Pit stop timing and predictions based on this
* Traction control emulation
* Properties used for car specific dashboard configuration and LED animations

That being said, cars and tracks that are not supported is not a problem at all. The plugin will be lacking some properties, but is still a heavy-hitter.&#x20;
