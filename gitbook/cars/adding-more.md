# Adding more

Mapping out tracks and cars is time consuming. Tracks are fairly quick, maybe about 30 minutes per configuration, but mapped tracks wont contribute all that much to the plugin. Mapping cars can take several hours, and with each new car I add custom elements in the [Dashboard](https://github.com/andreasdahl1987/DahlDesignDash) and custom LED profiles in the LED plugin.

You can help speed things up by visiting the [community spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qfWFea4hHLUym3DeUvXeUEGuHvSiPWJE3HmdibiLCyk/edit#gid=0) and plot out some values for your favourite un-supported cars and tracks!
