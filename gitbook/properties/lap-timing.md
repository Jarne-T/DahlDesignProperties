# ⏱ Lap timing

Propertes based on recodering, storing and tracking info about your laps. Built into the plugin is a system for storing your **lap records in a .csv file**. This file is automatically generated in your SimHub main folder, and you can view you lap times there. The reasoning for this is that the _PersistantTrackerPlugin.AllTimeBest_ lap times will include corner cutting/off-track lap times, as well as joker laps for rally cross, making it useless in many cases. Also, the .csv store additional information on these lap times, used for other calculations.&#x20;

The plugin also features a **lap time delta system**, completely indenpentent from iRacing or SimHub delta telemetry. It is based on recodring your lap time at 60 checkpoints around the track, for previous lap, session best land and lap record -> and then comparing your current lap on each checkpoint. The motivation to build this system is that the delta from telemetry was often confusing and not matching session best and lap record laps. It was hard to tell what the delta was referring to. Also, last lap delta was not availble.&#x20;

The downside of this delta system is that the 60 Hz data flow limits the resolution of lap timing. So the delta values produced are not accurate to the 0.001s. They are very accurate to 0.1s, and fairly accurate to the 0.01s.&#x20;

The **delta change** properties are strings of several values that represent delta changes over a given number of mini sectors (20). This is to avoid having to make 60 properties for delta change. You can extract the sector you want using the the javascript split() command in the dashboard editor; see how I did it in Dashboard.
