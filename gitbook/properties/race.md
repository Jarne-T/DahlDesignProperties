# üèÅ Race

Properties relevant to the race.&#x20;

iRacing telemetry is full of seemingly strange developer decisions. One of them is no not update race position untill you're completed a lap. This plugin will give live updated race positions. Not only for you, but also other drivers. Another importat feature is the **LapsRemaining** property, which uses a detailed algorithm for determining how many more laps we can expect to drive. This is affected by a lof of factors, such as:

* Type of session (lap determined, time determined or both)
* Leader pace, leader track position
* Your pace (has its own algorithm for excluding off-track laps, in-laps, out-laps, etc.) and track position
* Pit stop duration
* Quirky things like standing in front or behind start/finish line on the grid and corrections for strange lap-counting i iRacing telemetry

A lot of effort has gone into this property since it is used for fuel and strategy calculations, amongst other things.&#x20;

Another feature worth mentioning is the spotter calls, which will give you the name of the driver on the side of you, and also giving to the distance to the car next to you - for both sides. The plugin will remember the driver first entering your "space", and by process of elimination figure out who is on the other side, and the distance to that driver as well.&#x20;
