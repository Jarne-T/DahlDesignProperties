# â¤´ Pit Exit

Properties based on pit stop duration, cgiving a forecast on positions lost and traffic on pit exit. For the most accurate prediction, both track and cas should be supported. If only car is supported, it should still be fairly accurate for almost all tracks (+/- 3 seconds).&#x20;

The **PitExitCar** properties are produced for the 14 closest cars (geographically closest on pit exit). The number doesn't mean anything, but the way these properties are used in Dashboard is to fill a timeline showing -10 to +10 seconds, placing the cars on this timeline. I figured 14 cars in the span of 20 seconds would suffice, except for oval racing.&#x20;
