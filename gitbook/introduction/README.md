# Getting started

### About the plugin

This plugin gives you the most out of the existing iRacing telemetry by creating new SimHub properties through complex algorithms, tracking data through your sessions, storing data and using mapped out data for specific cars and tracks. The list of features is too long to quickly summarize, but it is safe to say this plugin will open a new world of possibilities for custom dashboard building for iRacing.

If not building your own dashboard, the Dahl Design Dashboard is built using these properties; or the other way around -> the property plugin was been made to enable the great features of this dashboard.
