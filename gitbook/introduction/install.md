* Get the latest release from GitHub repository page. You'll only need the `DahlDesign.dll` file.
* The file goes into your SimHub main folder. Typically C:\Program Files(x86)\SimHub
* Restart SimHub and you'll get a prompt that a new plugin has been found.

### Plugin in SimHub

You'll find the plugin here. You can also check the box to have a shortcut to the plugin menu on the left hand side. The menu has a lot of useful content, so I would strongly recommend it.

### Additional setup

#### Wheel slip

A special feature that requires a little extra setup is the **wheel slip properties.** These properties use the ShakeITMotorsV3Plugin to get slip values, then filters these values a bit.

You'll have to activate the slip effects in the ShakeIT Motors plugin page and export the values as a properties named "WheelSlip". Case sensitive. If you dont need the effect for you Arduino, just set volume to 0.

#### Plugin setup

Navigate to the **Plugin setup** page in the plugin menu. Bind you shifter paddles/sequential shifter. A few calculations in the plugin needs to know if you've done a gearshift, and by the time the iRacing telemetry has updated your current gear, the relevant information is already lost. So keeping track of the actual shifter button press is necessary.&#x20;

#### Steering angle

Navigate to the **Controllers** page in the plugin menu. Under **Wheel base** you'll be able to type in the wheel base steering axis. Make sure the controllers input plugin is active (Settings->Plugins->Controllers input) and search for your wheel base in the **Available properties** tab. Type in the name of the steering axis as the example explains. This is used to make a property [DahlDesign.SteeringAngle] which can be used in the dashboard editor, and is also used for some cars in Dahl Design iRacing dashboard. .&#x20;
