# Install

* Get the latest release from GitHub repository page. You'll only need the `DahlDesign.dll` file.
* The file goes into your SimHub main folder. Typically C:\Program Files(x86)\SimHub
* Restart SimHub and you'll get a prompt that a new plugin has been found.&#x20;

You'll find the plugin here. You can also check the box to have a shortcut to the plugin menu on the left hand side. The menu has a lot of useful content, so I would strongly recommend it.&#x20;
