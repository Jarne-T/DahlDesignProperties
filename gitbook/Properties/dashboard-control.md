# ðŸŽ› Dashboard control

These properties are used to control visibility of elements and animate the PitMenu and InCarMenu in Dashbaord. They all require a button/rotary switch to be assigned.&#x20;

If you're not using Dashboard, you can still use these button mappings and these properties to control visibility of elements in your own dashboard template.

| TCOffTimer      | Timer for deactivation of traction control on eligible cars (e.g. Ferrari 488 GT3, Porsche 919).
