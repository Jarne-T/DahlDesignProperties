# ðŸš€ Launch

Properties used in the launch screens in Dashboard.

The values are based on dual clutch release, meaning you use two clutch inputs -> one for 100% clutch and one for the **bite point.** Typically you give full throttle with both inputs pressed, then release the 100% clutch to get a good launch.

Dashboard has two launch screens, one for cars where you can use 100% throttle, and one for cars where both throttle and clutch have to be managed.
